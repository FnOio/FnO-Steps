The purpose of OSLO-STEPS is to describe user journeys as sequences of conditional steps 
for governmental public services, from the user perspective. 
As a possible application, a planning-engine is supposed to build plans given the steps to reach a goal. 
These plans are first optimized and then personalized. 
The described application is foreseen to present different plans to the user and perform A/B testing of the user interface.

Possible use-cases within the frame of the FAST project were discussed in the project consortium, and a use-case was selected.
Finding information regarding public services is difficult for citizens, 
as they often have to interact with multiple eGovernment systems which differ between regions and/or countries. 
Aligning public services is one objective of the EU Single Market, 
which stipulates the free movement of goods, services and capital across the EU [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="bibliography" href="#bib-CPSV-AP">CPSV-AP</a></cite>]. 
Citizens usually interact with the government based on a change in their immediate situation. 
Such a situation change is described as life events. 
Several life events were defined on European level [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="bibliography" href="#bib-CPSV-AP">CPSV-AP</a></cite>]. and were used by initiatives 
such as [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="bibliography" href="#bib-OSLO">OSLO</a></cite>] 
and [<cite><a class="bibref" rel="bibliography" href="#bib-ISA">ISAÂ²</a></cite>], to group public services accordingly.

Given multiple possible life events, selecting one of it as a use-case was on the agenda of a 
consortium meeting on the 26th of June 2018. 
Existing life events, such as "Finding a new job", and "Looking for a new place to live"
were discussed and based on a mix of complexity, feasibility and available consortium-resources, 
the life event "Onboarding in a new municipality" was selected as use-case.
