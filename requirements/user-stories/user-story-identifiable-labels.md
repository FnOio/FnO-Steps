## Name

Identifiable labels

## Description

When generating user interfaces (UIs) for steps of a workflow,
each step can have multiple human-readable descriptions.
This can be the case if e.g. a previously executed natural language extraction process
creates different labels with possibly varying quality.

Different natural language descriptions influences the cost of a step,
and thus one need to be able to refer to a specific description and assign a cost.
