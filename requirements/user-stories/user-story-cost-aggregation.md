Cost aggregation

## Description
**Question**: *The specified weights (duration, cost, success and comfort) are just names given to the number and are not fixed, right? 
But how is it with the number of these weights, does it have to be four weights?*

**Answer**: we can have a different number, but it needs to be fixed beforehand and we need to agree on how we handle them: 
the overall cost is the sum of all costs involved, the overall success is the product of all success values of all steps involved. 

So: we need a list of weights and we need to say whether we take the sum, the product or whatever of these.
