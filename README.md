# OSLO-STEPS

OSLO-STEPS data model

## internal readme

- lutra is WIP to see how to populate steps and shapes from another format (also docker)
- generate-ontology-documentation _is_ used
- *.vsdx: visio file: diagram
- there are 3 levels: journey - container - component: UX is always 3 levels

### Possible issues

- cost vocabulary is unspecified
- CCCEV 2.0 alignment?
  - CCCEV 1.0: too much document-oriented
  - step: need input (criteria), produces output (evidence)
  - criterium you can satisfy with different evidences
  - requirementsResponse: this is a concrete instance of a requirement response, related to evidence (now SupportedValue in CCCEV2)
  - CPSV?
    - OSLO-STEPS: somewhere in between CCCEV or CPSV?
      - does a state consist of evidence?
